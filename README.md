Brief Description: We have been assigned to the case study about "A course scheduling system". 
It contains 25 empty slots for storage from Monday to Friday excluding lunch time. Each slot can only store a subject. The class starts at 8.30 AM and ends at 4.50 PM.
The duration for each slot is an hour and 20 minutes. Item is stored based on course code. Each course should have 2 meetings in a week. 

For this task, the XAMPP Control Panel and Visual Studio were used for the development of the project. Using a guide found on YouTube for the development, we managed to complete this task by modifying the coding to suit the case study requirements. Once the code was finished, we connected it to the local host and doing a lot of additional modifications we were able to complete the case study.
